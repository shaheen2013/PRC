/**
 * Sharpspring REST API Connection object designed to make coders' lives easier.
 *
 * This class contains methods corresponding to many API methods, to ease
 * working with the API. As some details of the API calls (parameters and
 * response format) are not documented extensively, the methods in this class
 * take care of abstracting away some tediousness and provide documentation with
 * each method. All methods wrap around a generic call() method; it is allowed
 * but hopefully not necessary to use call(), because wrapper functions exist.
 *
 * For more information on the values contained within the 'table row(s)' that
 * calls return as arrays, see Sharpspring's API ("Schema") documentation.
 *
 * This class performs quite strict validation on the JSON values returned from
 * API calls, especially since the API response can contain duplicate info. If
 * the response has an unexpected format, an exception is thrown. This has the
 * advantage of calling code being able to trust returned values, making its
 * 'flow' easier. The flip side is that it needs to implement good exception
 * handling; if Sharpspring decides to make changes to undocumented parts of the
 * API response, this class will likely start throwing exceptions and will need
 * to be changed.
 *
 * Create/update methods (for leads only, so far) make use of our ValueObject
 * structures (and unfortunately rely on schema information contained in them,
 * to fix bogus API return values). But callers are not forced to use these
 * ValueObjects: the calls also accept arrays as input.
 *
 * Create/update/delete methods which handle multiple leads will throw a
 * SharpSpringRestApiException if at least one of the objects returns failure.
 * The caller is then responsible for checking which objects succeeded/failed,
 * from the exception's getData() return value.
 *
 * This class does not handle the connection/authentication details of making
 * the actual REST call; this responsibility is delegated to a 'client' object
 * that must be injected in the constructor, so that details around networking /
 * credentials can be handled completely separately from this class' logic.

     * This is automatically done by create/update calls so calling this method
     * explicitly from outside the library should not be needed.
     *
     * (When passing a ValueObject,) the difference with the toArray() method on
     * the object itself is that this method additionally maps custom properties
     * that are set on this Connection instance.
     *
     * Also, this accepts arrays as input; the differences with objects are:
     * - 'internal' properties are not filtered out (because arrays don't have
     *   these);
     * - null values are not filtered out (because arrays can have properties
     *   removed, so if a value should not be sent then it's expected to not be
     *   in the array).
     * The other 'fix' (i.e. removing empty string values in nullable fields;
     * see comments in ValueObject) is done for arrays too. Because faulty
     * values which the API returns but would reject as input, should still be
     * fixed here; $con->updateLead($con->getLead(ID)) should not throw
     * exceptions; that would put an unreasonable burden on callers that want to
     * e.g. quickly fix values.

     * No 'double fixing' is done, i.e. toArray(INPUT) returns the same as

     * property. In other words;
     * - If a provided Lead has an existing emailAddress and no id, the lead
     *   corresponding to the e-mail is updated.
     * - If a provided Lead has an existing id and no emailAddress, the lead
     *   corresponding to the id is updated.
     * - If a provided Lead has an existing id and an emailAddress that does not
     *   exist yet, the lead corresponding to the id is updated just like the
     *   previous case. (The e-mail address is changed and the old e-mail
     *   address won't exist in the database anymore.)
     *
     * BEHAVIOR WARNINGS: (tested on API v1.117, 20161205):
     *
     * - If a provided Lead has an existing id and an emailAddress that already
     *   exists in a different lead, then ONLY the updateTimeStamp will be
     *   updated and the API call will return success, but NONE of the other
     *   fields will be changed.
     * - If a provided Lead has a nonexistent id (regardless whether the
     *   emailAddress exists) nothing will be updated even though the API call
     *   will return success!
     * - If a provided Lead has no id and no emailAddress: same.
     * - If a provided Lead has no id and an emailAddress that does not yet
     *   exist: same.
     *
     * - If an update does not actually change anything, the REST API will
     *   return an object-level error 302 "No table rows affected".
     *
     * While cases 2 and 3 are obvious (and it's understandable though
     * unfortunate that 4 does not create a new object), case 1 is a real
     * issue. This means that unless you *know* that the e-mail address in your
     * updated lead does not exist yet elsewhere in the Sharpspring database,
     * you cannot trust your updates. (So if you know you are not changing the
     * e-mail address with an update: you're fine. Otherwise: you're not, unless
     * you are sure it does not exist yet in another lead.) In this case you
     * *must* doublecheck whether the update succeeded by doing a getLead() on
     * the id you are updating, and seeing if the e-mail is actually the value
     * you expect. If not, you should assume the update silently failed.
     *
     * If an object-level error is encountered, the behavior is somewhat
