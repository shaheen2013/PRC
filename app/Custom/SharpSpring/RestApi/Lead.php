/**
 * The Lead table consists of prospects who are possibly interested in your
 * product. As a lead progresses through your pipeline, their status changes
 * from unqualified to qualified. A lead can be converted into a contact,
 * opportunity, or account.
 *
 * Different parts of the REST API seem to have a different understanding about
 * what are valid fields (tested on API v1.117, 20161205). We have:
 * - the return value from the getFields() call; this includes 'crmID' and
 *   custom fields but not 'accountID' and 'active'.
 * - the fieldnames returned by a getLead() call, which apparently returns all
 *   fields also when they are empty/null; this includes 'accountID', 'active'
 *   and custom fields but not 'crmID';
 * - the accepted fieldnames (as far we can tell this is the same as previous)
 * - the list of valid parameters we get back as part of an error message,
 *   when we try to set an invalid parameter/field; this includes 'accountID'
 *   and 'active'(?) but not crmID or any custom fields.
 *
 * The following fields are also (like crmID) part of the getFields() output but
 * not among properties returned for a lead. I haven't checked points 3 and 4
 * for them, but so far assume they are invalid just like crmID... Then again,
 * they could be read-only fields that only become visible after some action
 * happens inside Sharpspring.
 *   numBounces - int - Number of Bounces
 *   hardBounced - int - Hard Bounced Email Address
 *   hasOpportunity - bit - Has an Opportunity
 *   isQualified - bit - Is Qualified
 *   isContact - bit - Is Contact
 * These fields are therefore (like crmID) not defined below.

     * definition of 'timestamp' a bit, because there is no timezone
     * information. There is also no API documentation on what the timestamp
     * means. What we know so far is:
     * - the getLead and getLeads calls return Lead objects with
     *   updateTimestamp values expressed in your local timezone.
     * - the getLeadsDateRange call does too, since around 2017-07-26. (Before
     *   that, it was UTC.)
     * - Note we do not know how the 'local timezone' is defined! If you change
     *   the timezone of your Web UI account, do updates, and then change the
     *   timezome again... this has this has no effect on the updateTimestamp
     *   that is ultimately received through API calls.
     * So the working theory is
     * - The date is actually stored on the server in a proper timestamp format;
     * - The date for getLead(s) calls is always converted to "your" timezone,
     *   probably using timezone information that is somehow connected to your
     *   API key but which is not the timezone setting in your Web UI. (Unless
     *   it's IP based.)
     *
     * Let's assume this updateTimestamp is not updatable to specified values -
     * which is the only sane situation.
     * The author tested updating this value in november/december 2016 (with
     * api v1.117) and worryingly, it was. Then tested this again in january
     * 2017, and it was not. (This can mean several things: 1) the author is
     * braindead; 2) Sharpspring fixed this part of their API; 3) the
     * updateTimestamp is only updatable until the lead is 'locked' because it's
     * in use. Let's assume 1.)
